# eulers_prime
## What is It?
Euler's Number is a pretty popular topic in mathematics and computer science. It's the summation of an infinite series and most commonly known as _e_, the natural number. Given this irrational number, this web app is made to find the Xth occurrence of a Y-digit prime.

## Running the App
### Direct-Run
*Prerequisite: Flask*

I wanted to create this without a framework, but the task was going to make this an ever-larger project. So, at least for now, the app is using the Python Flask (micro)framework. At least it's a pretty lightweight framework. If you have Flask installed, just run it using `python web_app.py` and you're good to go.

### Virtual Environment
*Prerequisite: Virtual Environment, `pip`*

If you've got a virtual environment set up, then you can get all the prerequisites set up through there. Simply run it using `pip install -r requirements.txt` then `python web_app.py` and you're good to go.
